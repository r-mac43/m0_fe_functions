# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
    I am trying to get better about not spending as much time trying to figure out
    and make perfect all assignments, without stopping and reaching out for help.

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
    I would explain that a function is something that happens again and again. Like when you're done playing with your block and you put them in the bucket over and over again until you stop.

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
    Parameters are like drafting a great team of fantasy football players, but unless I set and lock in my line up , the argument, I will never win.

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
    I really struggles with multiple parameters when they are a mix of "strings" numbers.  I am not sure how to set up a correct argument.
